Additional notes:
- Data sent in JSON format between backend and frontend

To-Do
- Change all endpoints to be based on particular resource 




- Do i need a post request to return anything? Even if it is the newly created checklist item   
    - is this better as just a get request sent?    
    - this happens on the client side 
    - e.g a pop up and when you close out it gets again
    - keep is separate like this is just for posting 
- How do I want the categories to be sent from the client? As numbers? That might be easier?
    - categories would be known by client as id to category 
- to add specific endpoint in checklist to tick off item
    - /move/{checklist_id}
- How do I want to display the categories to the clients? How do I change numbers to text? SQL queries babyyyy
- Do i want after a post request, for the resource to be returned, or do I want the entire database to be returned, or do I want a get request to be sent after? 
- Can alwqays do first version then add additional features in 1.1
-  Item name, qty, and cat_id 
    - unit id in future version
- Categories are also an entity 
- Esp used to load the drop down that has all the categories 
- the mapping will happen then 
    - will require their own table in same db
    - Create category
    - get all categories 
    - delete category 
    - update category name
    - can use category ID in sending to client or
    - anytime you have an object referencing another object oyu think the client already knows about, use a reference ID
    - can send a caegory object 
    - the id should be the key thing to reference object
    - prioritise the ID that uniquely identifies each category 
        - if you want to expand with more details, include the entire field as an object
            - so like a nested object with the category object


- Names 
 - client could have as you type, it clicks suggestions, so you arent creating new items but passing in an existing one
- so you will still do that validation 

Sketch
- Draw up a UI 
- e.g. page showing entire inventory, form for adding
- how does the flow look? 

- resource
- URL should be the URL for the resource 
    - then have the various activites for the endpoint 


v1.1

- Scan to include in inventory (UPC barcode scanning)
