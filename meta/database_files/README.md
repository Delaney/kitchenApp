I am using this section to save information about my database. You might need to install a PDF viewer extension to view the proposed schema. I am using "vscode-pdf" on VScode.

As a summary, my Kitchenventory database schema includes the following tables:

1. Checklist Table: 
- This table stores the checklist items with their respective quantity, unit, category, timestamp, and purchased status. 
- It has a composite unique constraint on grocery_name and checklist_id. 
- The unit_id and category_id columns reference the primary keys in the unit and categories tables, respectively.

2. Categories Table: 
- This table holds the categories for the groceries. 
- Each category has a unique category_id, and the category_name column is constrained to be unique as well.

3. Unit Table: 
- This table stores the units of measurement for the groceries. 
- Each unit has a unique unit_id, and the unit_name column is constrained to be unique.

4. Inventory Table: 
- This table represents the inventory of groceries. 
- It includes the item name, quantity, unit, and category for each inventory item. 
- The item_name column is constrained to be unique. 
- The unit_id and category_id columns reference the primary keys in the unit and categories tables, respectively.

I have established the relationships between the tables through the foreign keys, in order to ensure data integrity and proper data referencing.
